Highly favorable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Factors\" title=\"Tropical cyclone\">environmental conditions</a> allowed the storm to undergo <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification\" title=\"Rapid intensification\">explosive intensification</a> as it approached the island arc. The hurricane reached Category&nbsp;5 strength on September 18 just before making landfall on Dominica, becoming the first Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on record to strike the island. After weakening slightly due to crossing Dominica, Maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern Caribbean with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind\" title=\"Maximum sustained wind\">maximum sustained winds</a> of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 908&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.81&nbsp;inHg). On September&nbsp;20, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewall_replacement_cycle\" title=\"Eyewall replacement cycle\">eyewall replacement cycle</a> took place, weakening Maria to a high-end Category&nbsp;4 hurricane by the time it struck Puerto Rico. Interaction with land further weakened the hurricane, though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas\" title=\"The Bahamas\">Bahamas</a>. Moving slowly to the north, Maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28. Embedded in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies\" title=\"Westerlies\">westerlies</a>, Maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open Atlantic, becoming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone\" title=\"Extratropical cyclone\">extratropical</a> on September 30 and dissipating by October 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria wrought catastrophic devastation to the entirety of Dominica, which suffered an island-wide communication blackout. Much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair, while the island&#39;s lush vegetation was practically eradicated. The islands of Guadeloupe and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique\" title=\"Martinique\">Martinique</a> endured widespread flooding, damaged roofs, and uprooted trees. Puerto Rico also suffered catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis; most of the island&#39;s population suffered from flooding and a lack of resources, compounded by the slow relief process. The storm caused the worst electrical blackout in US history, and in June 2018, thousands of homes and businesses were still without power.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-1\">[1]</a> Maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the Leeward Islands in two weeks, after Irma had made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Jose_(2017)\" title=\"Hurricane Jose (2017)\">Hurricane Jose</a> passed dangerously close shortly afterward, bringing tropical storm force winds to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbuda\" title=\"Barbuda\">Barbuda</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 28, 2018 (almost a year after the hurricane), Puerto Rico revised its official tally of 64<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-2\">[2]</a> killed in the hurricane up to 2,975, making the total death toll 3,059: an estimated 2,975 were killed in Puerto Rico,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-CBS_-_8-28-2018-3\">[3]</a> 65 in Dominica, 5 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic\" title=\"Dominican Republic\">Dominican Republic</a>, 4 in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe\" title=\"Guadeloupe\">Guadeloupe</a>, 4 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States\" title=\"Contiguous United States\">contiguous United States</a>, 3 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands\" title=\"United States Virgin Islands\">United States Virgin Islands</a>, and 3 in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti\" title=\"Haiti\">Haiti</a>.

With the median age of PREPA power plants at 44&nbsp;years, an aging infrastructure across the island made the electric grid more susceptible to damage from storms. Inadequate safety mechanism also plagued Puerto Rico&#39;s electric company, and local newspapers frequently reported on its poor maintenance and outdated control systems.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the non-profit environmental advocacy group <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council\" title=\"Natural Resources Defense Council\">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, the island&#39;s water system was already in substandard conditions prior to hurricanes Irma and Maria.

By September 15, 2017, 83% of the items there, including 90% of the water and all of the tarps and cots, had been deployed for post-Irma relief, mostly to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Maria arrived before supplies were replenished.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-28\">[28]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evacuation orders were issued in Puerto Rico in advance of Maria, and officials announced that 450 shelters would open in the afternoon of September 18.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-29\">[29]</a> By September 19, 2017, at least 2,000 people in Puerto Rico had sought shelter.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-30\">[30]</a> Using anonymous aggregate cell phone tracking data provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> from users that opted to share location data, researchers reported that travel from Puerto Rico increased 20% the day before the hurricane made landfall.
