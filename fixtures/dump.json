The system gradually intensified while moving toward the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles\" title=\"Lesser Antilles\">Lesser Antilles</a>, before becoming a hurricane on August&nbsp;28. Rapid intensification ensued, and on August 31, Dorian intensified into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_4\" title=\"Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\">Category 4</a> major hurricane. On the following day, Dorian reached <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_5\" title=\"Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\">Category 5</a> intensity, peaking with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale\" title=\"Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\">one-minute sustained winds</a> of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 910 millibars (26.87&nbsp;inHg) while making landfall in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_Cay\" title=\"Elbow Cay\">Elbow Cay</a>, Bahamas, at 16:40 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\" title=\"Coordinated Universal Time\">UTC</a>.

Extensive precautionary measures were taken to mitigate damage, especially in Puerto Rico, where one person died. Damaging winds primarily affected the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Islands\" title=\"Virgin Islands\">Virgin Islands</a> where gusts reached 111&nbsp;mph (179&nbsp;km/h). Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, impacts from the storm were relatively minor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 1, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the northeastern Bahamas, devastating the islands and generating destructive gusts up to 225&nbsp;mph (360&nbsp;km/h).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Meteorological history</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dorian_2019_track.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Dorian_2019_track.png/220px-Dorian_2019_track.png\" style=\"height:136px; width:220px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Map plotting the track and the intensity of the storm, according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale\" title=\"Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\">Saffir&ndash;Simpson scale</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of Dorian can be traced back to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_wave\" title=\"Tropical wave\">tropical wave</a> over the central Atlantic. On August&nbsp;23, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center\" title=\"National Hurricane Center\">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) began monitoring the potential for this system to develop into a tropical cyclone.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-1\">[1]</a> On August&nbsp;24, the system developed a closed low-level circulation detected by a satellite-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatterometer#radar_scatterometer\" title=\"Scatterometer\">scatterometer</a>. The NHC thus designated it as Tropical Depression Five at 15:00&nbsp;UTC, with the system then located about 805&nbsp;mi (1,295&nbsp;km) east-southeast of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados\" title=\"Barbados\">Barbados</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-2\">[2]</a> The cyclone then organized into Tropical Storm Dorian about six hours later. The system was battling with dry air; its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection\" title=\"Atmospheric convection\">convection</a> waxed and waned. Later on August&nbsp;25, Dorian began strengthening, reaching an intensity of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) and expanding slightly in size.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-auto-3\">[3]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DorianISS.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/DorianISS.jpg/220px-DorianISS.jpg\" style=\"height:116px; width:220px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Dorian as seen from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station\" title=\"International Space Station\">ISS</a> on August 29</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Dorian continued moving west and came extremely close to Barbados, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-5\">[5]</a> It then started moving northwestward toward <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lucia\" title=\"St. Lucia\">St. Lucia</a> and entering the Caribbean Sea. The storm underwent a center relocation further north, to the west of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique\" title=\"Martinique\">Martinique</a>, causing the island to experience tropical storm-force winds as well.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-6\">[6]</a> Dorian had been predicted to travel northwest and pass over or near the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic\" title=\"Dominican Republic\">Dominican Republic</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico\" title=\"Puerto Rico\">Puerto Rico</a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-7\">[7]</a> possibly allowing their mountainous terrain to weaken the tropical storm. At that time, dry air and wind shear were expected to prevent Dorian from attaining hurricane status&mdash;although just barely.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-8\">[8]</a> However, Dorian took a more northerly track than expected, causing it to pass to the east of Puerto Rico and hit the Virgin Islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August&nbsp;28, Dorian intensified into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_1\" title=\"Saffir\u2013Simpson scale\">Category 1</a> hurricane as it approached <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Thomas_Island\" title=\"St. Thomas Island\">St. Thomas</a> in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Virgin_Islands\" title=\"U.S. Virgin Islands\">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>, where hurricane-force winds were recorded; at 18:00 UTC that day, Dorian made landfall on St. Thomas at Category 1 intensity.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-9\">[9]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-CBC_1-10\">[10]</a> However, the hurricane&#39;s small size prevented mainland Puerto Rico from experiencing hurricane- or tropical storm-force winds, although this was not the case for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Virgin_Islands\" title=\"Spanish Virgin Islands\">Spanish Virgin Islands</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Hurricane Dorian making landfall on Abaco Island as a strong Category 5 hurricane, on September 1.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the system moved north past the Virgin islands, the storm entered a more favourable environment. However, dry air was still in the system from its journey through the Caribbean sea and the lesser Antilles, and this gave the storm an erratic look and was lopsided. There was no more dry air afterwards, so the storm began to mix out the dry air, and on the next day, the system started to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification\" title=\"Rapid intensification\">rapidly intensify</a>, reaching Category 2 status early on August 30.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-12\">[12]</a> Rapid intensification continued, and the storm eventually reached major hurricane status several hours later, on the same day.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-13\">[13]</a> This strengthening trend came to a halt for the remainder of the day, but soon resumed.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-14\">[14]</a> The system continued strengthening, and on August 31, Dorian attained Category 4 major hurricane status.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-15\">[15]</a> Dorian reached Category 5 intensity on the following day.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-16\">[16]</a> On the morning of September 1, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropsonde\" title=\"Dropsonde\">dropsonde</a> deployed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA_Hurricane_Hunters\" title=\"NOAA Hurricane Hunters\">a NOAA aircraft</a> measured a wind gust of 176 knots (326&nbsp;km/h; 203&nbsp;mph) at the surface. With one-minute sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum pressure of 913&nbsp;mb (hPa; 26.96&nbsp;inHg), the NHC noted that Dorian was the strongest hurricane in modern records to affect the northwestern Bahamas.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-17\">[17]</a> At 16:40 UTC on September 1, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaco_Islands\" title=\"Abaco Islands\">Great Abaco Island</a> in the Bahamas, with one-minute sustained winds of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h) wind gusts up to 225&nbsp;mph (360&nbsp;km/h), and a central barometric pressure of 911 millibars (26.9&nbsp;inHg).<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-18\">[18]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-19\">[19]</a> The storm&#39;s central pressure bottomed out at 910 millibars (26.87&nbsp;inHg) within a few hours, as Dorian reached its peak intensity during landfall.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-Discussion_Number_34-20\">[20]</a> Hurricane Dorian&#39;s forward speed decreased around this time, slowing to a westward crawl of 5&nbsp;mph (7&nbsp;km/h).<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-Discussion_Number_34-20\">[20]</a> At 02:00 UTC on September 2, Dorian made landfall on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bahama\" title=\"Grand Bahama\">Grand Bahama</a> near the same intensity, with the same sustained wind speed.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian#cite_note-21\">[21]</a> The storm continued moving very slowly, at some points at only 1&nbsp;mph (1.6&nbsp;km/h) over Grand Bahama.

However, the storm&#39;s intensity fluctuated between Categories&nbsp;2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewall_replacement_cycle\" title=\"Eyewall replacement cycle\">eyewall replacement cycles</a>. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by early on the next day, and acquiring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_tropical_cyclone\" title=\"Annular tropical cyclone\">annular characteristics</a>. Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure\" title=\"Atmospheric pressure\">pressure</a> of 914&nbsp;hPa (27.0&nbsp;inHg). Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category&nbsp;5 status before making landfall in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba\" title=\"Cuba\">Cuba</a>. Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category&nbsp;4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straits_of_Florida\" title=\"Straits of Florida\">Straits of Florida</a>, before making landfall on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudjoe_Key,_Florida\" title=\"Cudjoe Key, Florida\">Cudjoe Key</a> on September&nbsp;10. Irma then weakened to Category&nbsp;3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Island,_Florida\" title=\"Marco Island, Florida\">Marco Island</a> later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama\" title=\"Alabama\">Alabama</a> and ultimately dissipated on September&nbsp;13 over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri\" title=\"Missouri\">Missouri</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The storm caused catastrophic damage in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbuda\" title=\"Barbuda\">Barbuda</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Barth%C3%A9lemy\" title=\"Saint Barth\u00e9lemy\">Saint Barth&eacute;lemy</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin\" title=\"Saint Martin\">Saint Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguilla\" title=\"Anguilla\">Anguilla</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Islands\" title=\"Virgin Islands\">Virgin Islands</a> as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane.

The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)\" title=\"Ridge (meteorology)\">subtropical ridge</a> to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category&nbsp;5 intensity at 18:00&nbsp;UTC that day east of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba\" title=\"Cuba\">Cuba</a> as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayo_Romano\" title=\"Cayo Romano\">Cayo Romano, Cuba</a>, at 03:00&nbsp;UTC on September 9, with winds of 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h). This made Irma only the second Category&nbsp;5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Cuba_hurricane\" title=\"1924 Cuba hurricane\">1924 Cuba hurricane</a>. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category&nbsp;2 storm later on September 9.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma#cite_note-TCR-7\">[6]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><a class=\"image\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irma_%26_Andrew_comparison.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Irma_%26_Andrew_comparison.jpg/220px-Irma_%26_Andrew_comparison.jpg\" style=\"height:124px; width:220px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Combined satellite image of Hurricanes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew\" title=\"Hurricane Andrew\">Andrew</a> and Irma, showing the size comparison of the storms</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida\" title=\"Florida\">Florida</a> around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a>. Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye becoming better defined.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma#cite_note-TCR-7\">[6]</a> In addition, Irma&#39;s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of 80&nbsp;mi (130&nbsp;km) and gale-force winds spanning 220&nbsp;mi (350&nbsp;km) in diameter.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma#cite_note-14\">[13]</a> The cyclone made landfall in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudjoe_Key,_Florida\" title=\"Cudjoe Key, Florida\">Cudjoe Key, Florida</a>, at 13:00&nbsp;UTC on September 10, at Category&nbsp;4 intensity, with winds of 130&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h). Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category&nbsp;3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30&nbsp;UTC, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Island,_Florida\" title=\"Marco Island, Florida\">Marco Island, Florida</a>, with sustained winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category&nbsp;3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida\" title=\"Tampa, Florida\">Tampa</a> as a weakening Category&nbsp;1 hurricane around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation &ndash; though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.

Highly favorable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Factors\" title=\"Tropical cyclone\">environmental conditions</a> allowed the storm to undergo <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification\" title=\"Rapid intensification\">explosive intensification</a> as it approached the island arc. The hurricane reached Category&nbsp;5 strength on September 18 just before making landfall on Dominica, becoming the first Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on record to strike the island. After weakening slightly due to crossing Dominica, Maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern Caribbean with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind\" title=\"Maximum sustained wind\">maximum sustained winds</a> of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 908&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 26.81&nbsp;inHg). On September&nbsp;20, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewall_replacement_cycle\" title=\"Eyewall replacement cycle\">eyewall replacement cycle</a> took place, weakening Maria to a high-end Category&nbsp;4 hurricane by the time it struck Puerto Rico. Interaction with land further weakened the hurricane, though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas\" title=\"The Bahamas\">Bahamas</a>. Moving slowly to the north, Maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28. Embedded in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies\" title=\"Westerlies\">westerlies</a>, Maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open Atlantic, becoming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone\" title=\"Extratropical cyclone\">extratropical</a> on September 30 and dissipating by October 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria wrought catastrophic devastation to the entirety of Dominica, which suffered an island-wide communication blackout. Much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair, while the island&#39;s lush vegetation was practically eradicated. The islands of Guadeloupe and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique\" title=\"Martinique\">Martinique</a> endured widespread flooding, damaged roofs, and uprooted trees. Puerto Rico also suffered catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis; most of the island&#39;s population suffered from flooding and a lack of resources, compounded by the slow relief process. The storm caused the worst electrical blackout in US history, and in June 2018, thousands of homes and businesses were still without power.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-1\">[1]</a> Maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the Leeward Islands in two weeks, after Irma had made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Jose_(2017)\" title=\"Hurricane Jose (2017)\">Hurricane Jose</a> passed dangerously close shortly afterward, bringing tropical storm force winds to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbuda\" title=\"Barbuda\">Barbuda</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 28, 2018 (almost a year after the hurricane), Puerto Rico revised its official tally of 64<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-2\">[2]</a> killed in the hurricane up to 2,975, making the total death toll 3,059: an estimated 2,975 were killed in Puerto Rico,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-CBS_-_8-28-2018-3\">[3]</a> 65 in Dominica, 5 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic\" title=\"Dominican Republic\">Dominican Republic</a>, 4 in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe\" title=\"Guadeloupe\">Guadeloupe</a>, 4 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States\" title=\"Contiguous United States\">contiguous United States</a>, 3 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands\" title=\"United States Virgin Islands\">United States Virgin Islands</a>, and 3 in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti\" title=\"Haiti\">Haiti</a>.

With the median age of PREPA power plants at 44&nbsp;years, an aging infrastructure across the island made the electric grid more susceptible to damage from storms. Inadequate safety mechanism also plagued Puerto Rico&#39;s electric company, and local newspapers frequently reported on its poor maintenance and outdated control systems.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the non-profit environmental advocacy group <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council\" title=\"Natural Resources Defense Council\">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, the island&#39;s water system was already in substandard conditions prior to hurricanes Irma and Maria.

By September 15, 2017, 83% of the items there, including 90% of the water and all of the tarps and cots, had been deployed for post-Irma relief, mostly to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Maria arrived before supplies were replenished.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-28\">[28]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evacuation orders were issued in Puerto Rico in advance of Maria, and officials announced that 450 shelters would open in the afternoon of September 18.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-29\">[29]</a> By September 19, 2017, at least 2,000 people in Puerto Rico had sought shelter.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria#cite_note-30\">[30]</a> Using anonymous aggregate cell phone tracking data provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> from users that opted to share location data, researchers reported that travel from Puerto Rico increased 20% the day before the hurricane made landfall.
